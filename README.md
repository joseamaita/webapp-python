# Guide for Web Development with Python

## Introduction

There are many web frameworks for Python; some provide more facilities 
than others, some offer a greater degree of flexibility or more 
extensibility. Some try to provide everything you need for a web 
application and require the use of very specific components, whereas 
others focus on giving you the bare minimum so that you can pick only 
the components your application needs.
